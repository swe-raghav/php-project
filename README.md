# php-project
  
This project is about creating an online examination platform using php language. 
Initially a design page is created for entering the student's register number(given before conducting the examination) and username respectively. 
Next the instructions for attending the test are listed. 
At the next page, the online examination starts.
A timer is set for one hour after which the answers will be submitted automatically. If finished earlier, submit button is clicked which is present at the bottom of the page. 
Finally the score will be updated in the server.
